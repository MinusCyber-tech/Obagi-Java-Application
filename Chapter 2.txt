2.1 Fill in the blanks
a) A(n) { begins the body of every method, and a(n) } ends the body of every method.
b) You can use the if statement to make decisions.
c) // begins an end-of-line comment.
d) Space, tab, and newline are called white space.
e) Keywords are reserved for use by Java.
f) Java applications begin execution at method main.
g) Methods System.out.println, System.out.print, and System.out.printf display information in a command window.

2.2 True or False
a) False – Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect program execution.
b) True – All variables must have a type declaration.
c) False – Java is case-sensitive, so number and NuMbEr are different variables.
d) False – The remainder operator % can be used with both integer and floating-point operands.
e) False – The operators *, /, and % have higher precedence than + and -.

2.3 Java Statements
a) int c, thisIsAVariable, q76354, number;
b) System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
c) int value = input.nextInt();
d) System.out.println("This is a Java program");
e) System.out.printf("This is a%nJava program%n");
f) if (number != 7) System.out.println("The variable number is not equal to 7");

2.4 Identify and Correct Errors
a) Incorrect: if (c < 7); System.out.println("c is less than 7");

Correction: Remove the semicolon after if:

java
Copy code
if (c < 7) System.out.println("c is less than 7");
b) Incorrect: if (c => 7) System.out.println("c is equal to or greater than 7");

Correction: Change => to >=:

java
Copy code
if (c >= 7) System.out.println("c is equal to or greater than 7");
2.5 Java Statements
a) // This program calculates the product of three integers
b) Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
c) int x, y, z, result;
d) System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
e) x = input.nextInt();
f) System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
g) y = input.nextInt();
h) System.out.print("Enter the third integer: ");
i) z = input.nextInt();
j) result = x * y * z;
k) System.out.printf("Product is %d%n", result);

2.6 Complete Program
java
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProductCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first integer: ");
        int x = input.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second integer: ");
        int y = input.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the third integer: ");
        int z = input.nextInt();

        int result = x * y * z;

        System.out.printf("Product is %d%n", result);
    }
}
Exercises
2.7 Fill in the blanks
a) Comments are used to document a program and improve its readability.
b) A decision can be made in a Java program with a(n) if statement.
c) Calculations are normally performed by arithmetic statements.
d) The arithmetic operators with the same precedence as multiplication are division (/) and modulus (%).
e) When parentheses in an arithmetic expression are nested, the innermost set of parentheses is evaluated first.
f) A location in the computer’s memory that may contain different values at various times throughout the execution of a program is called a(n) variable.

2.8 Java Statements
a) System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
b) a = b * c;
c) // This program performs a sample payroll calculation

2.9 True or False
a) False – Operators are evaluated based on precedence, not always from left to right.
b) True – The listed variable names are valid.
c) False – Operator precedence affects evaluation order.
d) True – Variable names cannot start with a number.

2.10 Output of Statements
java
Copy code
x = 2;
y = 3;
System.out.printf("x = %d%n", x); // Output: x = 2
System.out.printf("Value of %d + %d is %d%n", x, x, (x + x)); // Output: Value of 2 + 2 is 4
System.out.printf("x ="); // Output: x =
System.out.printf("%d = %d%n", (x + y), (y + x)); // Output: 5 = 5
2.11 Modified Variables
Modified variables are found in:
a) p = i + j + k + 7;
d) value = input.nextInt();

2.12 Correct Java Statements for y = ax³ + 7
Correct options:
a) y = a * x * x * x + 7;
d) y = (a * x) * x * x + 7;
e) y = a * (x * x * x) + 7;

2.13 Order of Evaluation
a) x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1; → x = 7 + 18 / 2 - 1; → x = 7 + 9 - 1; → x = 15
b) x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2; → x = 0 + 4 - 1; → x = 3
c) x = (3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / 3))); → x = 3 * 9 * (3 + 9); → x = 3 * 9 * 12; → x = 324

2.14 Displaying Numbers
a) System.out.println("1 2 3 4");
b)

Copy code
System.out.print("1 ");
System.out.print("2 ");
System.out.print("3 ");
System.out.print("4 ");
c) System.out.printf("%d %d %d %d%n", 1, 2, 3, 4);
