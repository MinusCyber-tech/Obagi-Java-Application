1.7 Two Compilation Phases in Java
Compilation Phase: The Java compiler (javac) translates the source code (.java file) into bytecode (.class file).
Execution Phase: The Java Virtual Machine (java command) loads and executes the bytecode.

1.8 Object-Oriented Concepts Applied to a Watch
Object: A watch is an object.
Attributes: Size, color, weight, brand, battery life, etc.
Behaviors: Showing time, setting an alarm, stopwatch function.
Class: "Watch" is a class, and different brands/models are objects of this class.
Inheritance: An alarm clock inherits features from a basic watch and adds an alarm function.
Modeling: A watch can be modeled in a software system with appropriate attributes and behaviors.
Messages: A watch receives a message when the user presses a button to adjust time.
Encapsulation: The internal mechanism of timekeeping is hidden from the user.
Interface: Buttons and screen allow interaction with the user.
Information Hiding: The user doesn't need to know how the watch's quartz oscillator works, only how to read the time.
Making a Difference

1.9 Carbon Footprint Calculator
Research online resources like TerraPass to learn about carbon footprint formulas.
This knowledge will be used to create a Java program that calculates carbon footprints based on energy consumption and travel habits.

1.10 BMI Calculator
Use the Body Mass Index (BMI) formula:
ùêµ
ùëÄ
ùêº
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
weight (kg)
A future Java program will use this formula to calculate BMI based on user input.

1.11 Attributes of Hybrid Vehicles
Examples:  Tesla Model 3, Honda Insight, Ford Fusion Hybrid.
Attributes: Battery type, capacity, fuel efficiency (mpg), electric range, charging time.

1.12 Gender Neutrality
A program would:
Read text input.
Identify gendered words using a dictionary mapping (e.g., "husband" ‚Üí "spouse").
Replace them with gender-neutral terms.
Edge case: Words may partially overlap (e.g., "man" in "woman"), causing unintended changes.
Solution: Use regex or dictionary-based word replacement
